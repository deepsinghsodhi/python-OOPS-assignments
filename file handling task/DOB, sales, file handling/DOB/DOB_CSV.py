'''
1) Write a python program to create / write a CSV file that store name, DOB of minimum 10 friends on
separated lines by taking user input

2) we will keep track of when our friendâ€™s birthdays are, and be able to find that information based on their name. 
Create a dictionary of names and birthdays(by reading the csv file). When you run your program it should 
display all the friends name and ask the user to enter a name, and return the birthday of that person back 
to them. The interaction should look something like this:
>>> Welcome to the birthday dictionary. We know the birthdays of:
Albert
Einstein
Benjamin
Franklin
Ada
Lovelace
john
...
>>> Who's birthday do you want to look up?
Franklin
>>> Franklin's birthday is 01/17/1706.

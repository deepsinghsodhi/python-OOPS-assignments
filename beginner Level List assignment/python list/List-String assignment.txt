1) Ross is an event organizer. He has received data regarding the participation of 
employees in two different events. Some employees have participated in only one event 
and others have participated in both events. Ross now needs to count the number of 
employees who have taken part in both events. The records received by Ross consist 
of employee ids, which are unique. Write a program that accepts the employee ids 
participating in each event (the first line relates to the first event and the second 
line relates to the second event). The program should print the number of common employee 
ids in both the events.

Suppose the following input is given to the program, where each line represents a different event:

1001,1002,1003,1004,1005
1106,1008,1005,1003,1016,1017,1112

Now the common employee ids are 1003 and 1005, so the program should give the output as:

========================================================================
2)Write a program which will accept a single pair of strings separated by a comma; 
the program should calculate the sum of ascii values of the characters of each string. 
The program should then subtract the sum of the ascii values of the second string from 
the sum of the ascii values of the first string.

Suppose the following input is given to the program: 

123ABC,456DEF   

Then the sum of the ascii values of the characters in '123ABC' is 348 and in '456DEF' it is 366. The Difference
 between these numbers is 348 – 366 = -18 
The corresponding output to be printed by the program is: 
-18

HINT: 
myvar = 'A'
print("The ASCII value of '" + myvar + "' is", ord(myvar))#65


===========================================================================
3) Print the following output as per given input
INPUT: A3B5C4
OOUTPUT: AAA BBBBB CCCC
<A3 means A should be print 3 times ,B5 B 5 times and so on>
===========================================================================
4) Write a  code to find the distance from Mumbai to major cities of India. Hint: Create an String list of 
major cities and integer list of distances. User  gives the city name and the same is searched  in the 
respective array and displays result.

city=[“Indore”,”Mumbai”,”Pune”]
dist=[1200,3500,7888];
e.g: 
Input: Enter city: Pune
Output:Distance is 7888

Input: Enter city: Indore
Output:Distance is 1200

===========================================================================
5)Reverse and add till palindrome
Any number with 2 digits or more; would be either a palindrome or not. If it’s not palindrome, 
you can reverse the number and add to the original number — and you may have to repeat this 
process for a few more times to make the number palindrome. Write a program that prints number 
of iterations it takes to make given number palindrome. From 10 to given number N, it should print the iterations.

For example:
10: 10 + 01 = 11 (a palindrome); # of iteration = 1
11: a palindrome; # of iteration = 0
..
..
19: 19 + 91 = 110; 110 + 011 = 121; a palindrome; # of iteration = 2
